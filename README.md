**Why this design?**

Since my desk is usually very populated, I frequently get the request from my girlfriend to clean and sort things out. One of the most likely type of things laying around is related to PCs, Cameras, or mobile phones. So usually it’s about USB PenDrives, USB Adapters or any type of SD Cards.
To make it sorted, I started to make this initial design to make room for that stuff instead of removing it by putting it into some dark and unknown (and most likely badly remembered) spot.
